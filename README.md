Finding the Optimal ICU Risk Score Using Time Iterative Random Forest Model

- Collaborated with a professor from the health study department. Utilized R to build a machine learning model to predict patients' risk of going to the ICU. 
- Joined data from various datasets, cleaned and visualized data, completed exploratory data analysis, then trained a random forest model, and did cross-validation. 
- Analyzed the result and came up with a new risk-scoring system that performs better than the national standard risk-scoring system.
